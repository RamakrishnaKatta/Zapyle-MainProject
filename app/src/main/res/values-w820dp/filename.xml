Sellers are responsible for all taxes including income tax, value added tax and service taxes associated with the purchase and sale of any items through the Service.

Zapyle only provides a service, is not involved in any transaction between buyers and sellers who use the Service, does not obtain title to any purchased items and does not act as the buyer or seller (or agent for buyers or sellers) with respect to any such transactions. Zapyle is not affiliated with or endorsed by any designer, manufacturer, retailer or brand of the items that users buy or sell on Zapyle's marketplace. There are risks that you assume when dealing with other users (including those who may be acting under false pretenses). You agree that all of these risks are borne by you, and not Zapyle. Zapyle does not control the behavior of users of the Service or the information or other content provided by other users that is made available through the Service. As a result, Zapyle does not guarantee or endorse the authenticity, quality, safety, or legality of any items offered or sold, the truth or accuracy of any listings, or the ability of sellers to sell items or of buyers to buy items. We cannot assure that all transactions will be completed. Additionally, Zapyle does not guarantee the ability or intent of users to fulfill their obligations in any transactions. Zapyle reserves the right to delay the completion of any transaction for a reasonable period of time for purposes of fraud detection and otherwise protecting Zapyle and its users from illegal or wrongful activities.

\n\n FOR EVERY TRANSACTION THAT IS COMMENCED THROUGH OUR SITE, YOU MUST MAKE YOUR OWN INDEPENDENT DETERMINATION REGARDING THE STATEMENTS, PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS OR THE REPRESENTATIONS OF THE OTHER PARTY AND THE PARTY'S ABILITY TO PAY FOR OR DELIVER THE ITEM(S) OFFERED. PLEASE USE CAUTION, COMMON SENSE, AND PRACTICE SAFE TRADING WHEN DEALING WITH OTHER USERS OR OTHERWISE USING THE SITE.

\n\n Item Comment System: User authentication on the Internet is difficult. Zapyle may attempt, but is under no obligation, to independently confirm a user's purported identity. Therefore, we have established an item commenting system to help you evaluate the user with whom you are dealing. We also encourage you to communicate directly with potential buyers or sellers through the features available through the Service.

\n\n Listing Restrictions: Zapyle prohibits the listing or sale of any item that is illegal to sell under any applicable law, statute, ordinance, or regulation,

You must describe your item (including the original price) and all terms of sale in your listing truthfully, accurately and reasonably completely. If you accept an offer, you shall complete the transaction with the buyer unless the transaction is prohibited by law or these Terms of Service, subject to the return procedure described below. You are also responsible for payment of the commission to Zapyle. An offer to sell may be retracted at any time prior to its acceptance, but not after.

\n\n Buying: If you agree to purchase an item through the Service and confirm the transaction, you are obligated to complete the transaction in accordance with the terms and conditions specified by the seller (e.g., with respect to the listing price), unless the transaction is prohibited by law or these Terms of Service, subject to the return procedure.

\n\n Shipping: Upon the confirmation of any purchase and sale transaction through the Service and payment of the required amount by the buyer, Zapyle will send to the seller's address indicated in the seller's account information a pre-paid shipping label for seller to ship the purchased item to the buyer. The seller must ship the purchased item to the buyer using the shipping label (and corresponding shipping method) required by Zapyle within 3 days after receipt of such shipping label. If the seller does not ship the purchased item within the required time period, then the seller will be notified that the order will be cancelled unless it is shipped within the time period required in such notice. Upon receipt of confirmation from the buyer that it has satisfactorily received and accepted the purchased item, Zapyle will credit seller's account in an amount equal to the purchase price received from the buyer, minus a commission to be retained by Zapyle. The buyer must confirm its acceptance within 3 days after receipt of the purchased item; if the buyer does not respond within such time period, the purchased item will be deemed accepted. Any funds credited to seller's account may be redeemed by the seller through a permitted third party payment provider (e.g., by ACH from Zapyle's chosen financial institution) or used by seller to purchase items listed by other sellers through the Service.

\n\n Returns: We do not currently allow returns of items, but we do strive to make our customers happy. If the item you receive is damaged, the wrong item or not as described, or if any items are missing, then you must report the issue in the Zapyle Service within 2 days after delivery of the purchased item.
